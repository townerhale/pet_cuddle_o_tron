# pet_cuddle_o_tron
Implement a serverless application using Step Functions, Lambda, SNS, SES, Api Gateway and S3 static web hosting. This application is serverless and event driven and is inactive when not used. Subsequently, resources will only be consumed when the application reacts towards user created events. Material used from Adrian Cantrill's course SAA-CO2.
